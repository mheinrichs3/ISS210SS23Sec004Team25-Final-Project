                <p class="masthead-subheading font-weight-light mb-0">Since the beginning of history, there has been a problem with police brutality in diverse communities. This goes all the way back to 1929, when the Illinois Association for Criminal Justice published the, "Illinois Crime Survey," which revealed data on police activity. This included the fact African Americans made up 5% of the area's population, and 30% of police killings icluded these victims. More recently, a 2021 statistic was released, showing people of color are twice as likely as white people to be shot and killed by police officers. This website brings awareness to all diverse communities and the police brutality that influences them daily. Bringing awareness to this revolting problem allows one to fully understand the affects it can have to someone's life and the way they navigate the world. </p>

                <div class="container"><p>Police Brutality is something that has been going on since the early 19th century and has just gotten worse since then. There are many things that can be defined as police brutality, it ranges from assault and battery to murder; or broadened terms including harassment, intimidation, and many other levels of mistreatment. Most police brutality is circulated around African Americans but ranges across all boards of diverse communities and minorities. In more recent and widely known affairs are the tragedies of George Floyd, Angelo Quinto, Elijah McClain, and Michael Brown amongst others. All were victims of police brutality in high ranges. Among all the protests being done and the attempt to diversify police forces the problem is not being subdued in any manner. There are over 1000 civilian deaths per year as a result of police brutality ranging across all minorities. The hopes of this website is to bring to the attention of others how in need the world is of help with the issue of police brutality and what can be done to help stop it.

In the article attached to the picture, it states that “the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collected data between 1999 and 2011 shows that Native Americans who are 0.8% of the US population, comprise 1.9% of police killings. They are 3.1 times more likely to be killed by police than whites. The EJI is a non-profit organization that provides legal representation to people who have been illegally convicted, unfairly sentenced, or abused in state jails and prisons. The organization was founded by Bryan Stevenson, who is an award winning Lawyer from Havard. He also wrote a book called “Just Mercy”, where he describes wrongful convictions and problems in the US Judicial System.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">The video cites the article “Police brutality after world war II”. This article begins by going over the four main reasons there was an escalation in police violence after the war. 1: minorities expected their contribution in the war to elevate their social status. 2: the migration of whites to cities caused policing to replace lynching. 3: minority populations increased causing them to be seen as more of a “threat”. 4: minority police officers committed violence themselves to be seen as good or equal by other officers. It then goes on to talk about the results of police brutality and how it has led to multiple race riots causing numerous deaths and hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage each. The article also discusses how people of all minorities suffer against police violence but struggle to do anything about it because they're minorities. Despite this campaigns against it have been launched and are still active today as it continues to be an issue everywhere in the country.</p>

It also talks about racial discrimination and profiling, and how often crooked cops’ behavior goes unpunished. In the last section titled “Remedies,” there are many suggestions of how these law enforcement violations can be avoided.

                                    <p class="mb-4">Amongst the many diverse communities present in the United States, Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders (AAPI), while underrepresented in police killings, are subject to lower forms of police brutality. These include, but aren’t limited to, taunting, offensive physical gestures, called names or insulted, and coughed or spit upon, among others as well on top of murder. This picture above represents a person of Asian American culture who is protesting the fact that their culture, while assumed by whites to be closer to white than color, are still violently harassed and subjected to levels of police brutality. The sign is made to show that the Asian American/Pacific Islander community want to be able to live their lives and walk through the streets without being subjected to harassment and brutality by anyone. Police Brutality against those in the AAPI community continues to rise and there are aspects of killings that are on par with those of the Black American and Native American communities. There are AAPI groups that have been actively put together trying to prevent and raise awareness of the brutality against them not just by police but by civilians in general. All brutality became more apparent and much worse during the COVID-19 pandemic and has continued to rise. Groups in support of the AAPI community are on the rise but are in need of more support to start making a true dent in the very apparent issue at hand.

                                    <p class="mb-4">Since the beginning of history, there has been a long range of police brutality dealing with the Latino community. This stems all the way back to 1918, when a group of Texas Rangers invaded the town of Porvenir, Texas and killed 15 Mexican men and boys. The police claimed that, "their victims had been connected to a recent raid at the nearby Brite Ranch." Created in the 1820's, the Texas Rangers were seen as American heroes. Although, this group was seen as racist, and violent as Mexicans and Native Americans were cleared for westward expansion. From 1915-1920, at least 5,000 Mexicans were killed by the Texas Rangers. More recently, on June 2, 2022 Sean Monterrosa was shot and killed by a detective for claiming he, "saw a gun." It was later found that the suspected gun was a hammer. As of June 9, 2022, 465 Latinos have been killed by the police. Today, there are many different communities like "Youth Justice Coalition L.A. and the Union del Barrio" have been working to bring justice for Latino families who have experienced police force. The Youth Justice Coalition L.A. has also fought to diminish cop presence in schools, as 73.4% of the student population is Latino. In conclusion, all communities as a whole need to work on building inclusion, and overall diminishing police brutality seen in the Latino community.  </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">For decades, there has been an ongoing struggle when it comes to preventing police brutality. Specifically, the highest number of fatalities when it comes to this violence is towards people of color and those in the community. The many cases of those who have been killed with no reasoning including Rodney King, Breanna Taylor, George Floyd and many other victims. Not only these events, but additional problems when it comes to the legal system and everyday interactions with respect that are underrepresented. According to <em>The Harvard Gazette</em> based on research by The Washington Post, findings claim, "Black Americans are killed by police at twice the rate of white Americans..." Previous actions taken in order to decrease the amount of police brutality have been very ineffective. Today, many people have been deciding and coming up with new solutions in order to efficiently prevent the continuing actions of police brutality. Including the resistance of arresting those with minor offenses, improved training when joining the police force, and an overall shift in the views that encourage the destructive and irreversible damage. Overall, our goal as a whole community is to learn to be united and to help stop the brutality that people of color face when interacting with the police force. </p>
